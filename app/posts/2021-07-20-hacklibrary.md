## Spending money on things OTHER than incentives for research
tbc

## What does 'X' mean?

### Windows password
The password that goes with your cipher when logging into something

### What's a cipher?
Your username for Windows and/or Microsoft on BSA systems and tools. It's five characters, usually based on your name in some way e.g. SASTO, for Sarah Stokes.

## Recording research

### Camtasia licenses
should be provided when you start in the following roles:
* Junior UR
* UR
* Senior UR

If it wasn't, you'll need to request one from your line manager.

### If you don't have Camtasia
OBS is a free open source tool that several people in the community recommend https://obsproject.com/

### using Microsoft Teams to record
The output of Teams record is a video file hosted in Microsoft Stream (which is BSA controlled). You can download files from Stream, but currently permissions are set so they cannot be shared with people outside the BSA. This may include contractors you're working with too, if they don't have a Cipher or NHS email address.
