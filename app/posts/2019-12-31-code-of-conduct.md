## Our standards

We want to ensure our community is open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and a healthy community.
In order to establish and maintain an inclusive environment we ask members to agree to the following code of conduct:

* **Have respect for all members of the community**
  We must ensure that participation in our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone space regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual identity, visible or invisible disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), level of experience, education, or socio-economic status.

* **Help create a safe and welcoming environment**
  We can do this by being open to diverse points of view, by inviting new people to join, by reaching out to newcomers to welcome them into the community, and by keeping things people share confidential if they specify it.

* **Do not assume everyone has the same context**
  Encourage questions.

* **Do not criticize the work of others â€“ provide constructive feedback instead** See [govdesign posters on giving, asking for, and receiving feedback](https://github.com/alphagov/govdesign/blob/master/Poster_GivingAskingReceivingFeedback.pdf)

* **Stay on topic**
  The community is about sharing design, user research, content design, and/or accessibility best practice, learnings, questions and challenges. If a topic goes off on a different, unrelated tangent we may ask you to hold off on the conversation until a more suitable time.

**Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:**

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
